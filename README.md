## üéØ Learning Path

1. Start with the database fundamentals (#01-#04)
2. Move on to data manipulation (#05-#14)
3. Progress to advanced queries (#15-#29)

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- SQL Server or MySQL installed
- Basic understanding of database concepts
- SQL client tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio)
